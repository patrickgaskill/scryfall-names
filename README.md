I wanted a simple way to get a list of card names from [Scryfall](http://scryfall.com) that I could copy-and-paste into [Deckbox](http://deckbox.org).

You can try it out at https://patrickgaskill.github.io/scryfall-names/ .

If you'd like to run this on your own machine, clone this repo and then:

    yarn
    yarn start
