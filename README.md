Archiving this since I've started using https://www.moxfield.com/ :)

I wanted a simple way to get a list of card names from Scryfall that I could copy-and-paste into Deckbox.

You can try it out at https://patrickgaskill.github.io/scryfall-names/ .

If youâ€™d like to run this on your own machine, clone this repo and then:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
